# GUI Document
In this document the entire UI of this project will be extensively laid out. All the elements  

## GUI STYLE

The GUI will combine both minimalistic and neon visual styles with the intention to bring to life a clean and clear interface that does not saturate the player with information. The GUI will be focused on aiding the player in focusing on the truly relevant and useful information, gameplay wise.

## Main Menu
The Main Menu will present the player with three different options:
- **New Game:** Starts a new game. In case there was an already existing saved game, it will be overwritten.

- **Continue:** Allows the player to continue the game from wherever he/she left it last time.

- **Options:** Sends the player to the *Options Menu*.

### Options Menu:
This menu will have the following elements:
- **Music Audio Volume Slider:** Modifies the music audio volume.

- **FX Audio Volume Slider:** Modifies the FX audio volume.

- **Control Remapping Window:** Allows to remap both keyboard and controller controls. There will be a tab on the window that, on click, will switch between keyboard and controller control schemes.

- **Screen Size Selector:** Switches the screen size between three pre-stablished sizes with the same aspect ratio (Fullscreen, windowed, window). The selector will have the common (<-- Fullscreen -->) design.

Moreover, there will be two additional buttons:
- **Back Button:** The current configuration will be saved and the player will be sent back to the **Main Menu**.

- **Default Configuration Button:** The current configuration will be reset to the original pre-established parameters.

## In-Game
**HUD**
- **Player Mouse Cursor:** Every time the player clicks on every part of the screen, there will appear a wave on the position  of the mouse to give feedback.

- **Minimap:** The minimap will be placed at the top right corner of the screen, and it will have a circular design. It's size can be modified in-game by clicking on the "+" and "-" tabs on the minimap's window. There will be 3 standard sizes, all of which will have been tested not to disturb teh gameplay in any way.

- **Unit Management:** To upgrade or modify the behaviour of the units, the units themselves need to be clicked on and a little window will appear with the different options of each of them. An information window will appear if the mouse is hovered over a specific unit.

- **Building Management:** To upgrade a building, the player will need to click on top of each individual building. The building menu that will appear will allow the player to upgrade the building if the required resources are at hand. 

- **Resources:** The current amount of the different resources will be displayed at the top left corner.

While in-game the player can access the *Pause Menu*, which offers the following options:
- **Music Volume Slider:**
- **FX Volume Slider:**
- **Save Game:**
- **Exit to Main Menu:**

The player can access to a pause menu to go back to title screen, save, go to options and to close the game.
