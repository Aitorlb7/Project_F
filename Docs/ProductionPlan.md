# Production Plan

For the production of this game, a 14 weeks plan divided in different stages and milestones, that will be completed using many techniques such as Sprints and a Gantt Chart, has been scheduled.

## General Calendar
### Gantt Chart

### Workable Hours
To be able to correctly and acurately distribute all the tasks that the project requires, every member of the development team filled a timetable with the amount of workable hours each could allocate to said tasks:

### Sprints (Kanban)

- **Weekly goals:** Set to make sure that progression is going according to the plan.

- **Weekly meetings:** will be placed every Thursday by 10:30 am and as long as it is possible, they will always be face-to-face meetings. These meetings will have a list of subjects to analyse and discuss, however, the main key point of these meeting will be to evaluate our progress (according to our weekly goals) and set the objectives for the next week.

- **During the week:** we will mantain constant communication through our *discord* server, where everyone can be tagged as their role, to coordinate properly any task related issue. Additionally, we will also keep a *Trello* board updated in order to keep track of the state of each tasks, either if they are done, in progress or still to do.

### Keeping track of the milestones
As there is a daunting amount of milestones to reach, a Trello board was created with all the tasks to do and at which stage each of them is at.

## Risk Contingency List
We have listed different situations that might happen during the production of the game and ranked them based on the probability of actually happening, their impact on the project and their possible solution

| **RISK**        | **PROBABILITY** | **IMPACT** | **SOLUTION** |
| --------------- |:---------------:| :----------:| ------------ |
| A teammate is not able to continue with the project| Really Low | Really High | The tasks assigned to the missing teammate will be divided with the rest of the group as long as it's possible, if it weren't possible we would study to eliminate that task from the final product |
| A team member falls sick    | High  | Low/Medium | Depending on the severity of the illness, either the weekly objectives that this team member had we'll be transferred to the team or if he is able to work but in a slower pace, management will assign a team member that is a bit ahead of schedule to assist him in their tasks|
| Weekly objectives are not completed   | Low| Medium | During our weekly metting, the tasks will be redistributed and we will evaluate why we weren't able to complete them. We will also remind ourselves that we should warn the team before the due date that a task might not be completed in time, so we can plan ahead and help each other |
| Milestones not completed in time   | Really Low | High | We will start evaluating what caused the issue so we don't encounter it again, after that, we will reschedule the missing items (in case we choose not to exclude them from the final product) and decide if we eliminate some from the next milestones in case we didn't consider them possible according to the new schedule |
| Main mechanic is not working properly   | Medium | High | The QA we'll get in touch with the Code lead to fix the issue as soon as possible |
| Visuals/Animations are not correclty placed | Low | Medium/High | The QA we'll get in touch with the Art&Audio lead to fix the issue as soon as possible |
| A team member's equipment fails | Very Low | Very High | The team member we'll be recommended to stay after class hours in the CITM in order to work from there, in case the CITM is closed we will try to get in touch with someone that can lend us some equipment |
