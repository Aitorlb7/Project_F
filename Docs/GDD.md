## Plot/Lore
We are in an era where the earth conquers other planetes- A message arrives to the earth notifying that planet “.....” has been conquered and that the troops had been devastated. You have sent to this planet to repopulate it. 

We are located in an era where earth and humans, tired of their worldly life, launched themselves into space exploration and intergalactic conquest. Soon, led by General “...”, they managed to conquer much of the other planets of the milky way. 
Anyway, the ambition of the general and his army was bigger than that. In a matter of months, better ships were built with better resources to withstand the dangers beyond the milky way. 
In this stage of conquests, “...” focused on the planet “...”. A planet 10 times larger than Earth, which contained an immense amounts of minerals and oil that could supply the earth for ages. The occupation of the planet was easy and fast and for a few years, an infinity resources could be extracted and “...” remained as a base of operations of the earth. But not anymore.


General “...” calls you and seems important. No signal is received from the planet. Apparently the monthly supplies haven’t reach its destination and nobody answers the calls. The general sends you there to gather information and inform about it as soon as possible. 

But when you arrive there, the expectations are different. The appearance of the planet is the same as when It was conquered years ago. 
If one day there was some kind of human civilization living there, it is gone. Everything is deserted and there is nothing left.Why are you the only human on a planet apparently uninhabited?  


## Game Pillars
**Exploration**: the dungeon pattern of the map. If you recruit an explorer, you can explore all the map to find resources as metal, fuel and others. The more explored and more recollected, the better base and troops you’ll have.

**System of hordes**: Horde after horde enemies will keep coming with a break in between so you can prepare yourself against the next seizing or even explore and complete quests.The time set between hordes it is thought to give the player enough time to engage on a new quest, without taking an eye out of the timer and the base. The difficulty will grow within the hordes.

**Building system**: Structure your base with a well balanced combination of the available buildings, defensive walls or structures which attack your enemies, building in charge to gather resources for your troops or upgrading your other buildings and the ones in charge of training and creating new troops to fight against the upcoming hordes.

**Combat system**: By clicking and dragging you can select the amount of units you want to move wherever the player wants a long as is a walkable area for the units. When enemy units slip into the attack area of those units, they will begin to attack them. This system improves the strategy side of the game, placing your units to defend the weaker side of your base.
