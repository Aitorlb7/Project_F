# Production Plan

For the production of this game, a 14 weeks plan divided in different stages and milestones, that will be completed using many techniques such as Sprints and a Gantt Chart, has been scheduled.

## General Calendar

### Sprints (Kanban)

- **Weekly goals:** Set to make sure that progression is going according to the plan.

- **Weekly meetings:** will be placed every Thursday by 10:30 am and as long as it is possible, they will always be face-to-face meetings. These meetings will have a list of subjects to analyse and discuss, however, the main key point of these meeting will be to evaluate our progress (according to our weekly goals) and set the objectives for the next week.

- **During the week:** we will mantain constant communication through our *discord* server, where everyone can be tagged as their role, to coordinate properly any task related issue. Additionally, we will also keep a *Trello* board updated in order to keep track of the state of each tasks, either if they are done, in progress or still to do.
