This game will have a retro Sci-fi soundtrack to give weight to the sci-fi style.

The game will have a song for each level and each song has a slow part and a fast one that will corresponds to each part of the level. There will be effects for almost every action the player does to get feedback and enemies too. 

## Music/Audio Style

Most of the FX that will be in the game are from "Kenney.nl" that are completely free and with no copyright. But, in some cases there will be modified with Audacity to suit to the type of game having a Sci-Fi thematic as lasers, robotic voices, etc.

In the case of music, there will be some tracks that will feel like in 80's. It will be inspired in some movies as "Kung Fury" or some games like "Far cry 3: Blood dragon". Every song is copyright free.


## Music and Fx

- *Menus:* When the game starts and goes to the main menu,there will be a voice that says the name of the game and then in menu there will be a retro calm track.

- *HUD:* We will have FX for the HUD from "Kenney.nl". Those FX will have a Sci-Fi thematic, like laser clicks. 

- *Gameplay:* When there are enemies in the screen, the music becomes stronger to make the action part more stressful and inmersive.

- *Loops & Transitions:* For each theme, we have a part of calm and a part when the song breaks, so, each part is looped and when the enemies appears it makes a transition to the huge part and while enemies still be in screen, the huge part will be in loop. Once the wave is overcome, the song ends and a new song sound with the same structure.
