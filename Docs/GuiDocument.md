# GUI Document

## GUI STYLE

The GUI will combine both minimalistic and neon visual style with the intention to design a clean and clear interface that does not saturate the player with information. The GUI will be focused on aiding the player in focusing on the truly relevant and useful information gameplay wise.

## HUD

On the HUD in gameplay, there will be a minimap on the top right part of the screen with a radial design, the minimap size can be modified touching it with the mouse with three size options to not disturb the visual zone. To upgrade units or modify them, clicking on them, it will emerge a little window to configure each unit. If you only put the mouse on the units or buildings without clicking, there will merge the most important info about them.
On the top left part of the screen there will be some info about your resources.
Every time the player clicks on every part of the screen, there will appear a wave on the position  of the mouse to give feedback.

## Menus
- **Main menu**
The Main Menu will present the player with three different options:
- **New Game:** Starts a new game. In case there was an already existing saved game, it will be overwritten.
- **Continue:** Allows the player to continue the game from wherever he/she left it last time.
- **Options:** Sends the player to the *Options Menu*. 

- **Options**
In this menu, the player can configure audio values, configure controls of keyboard or controller. An option to configure the screen size, that allows three sizes with the same ratio. When the player clicks on back button, the game will save the configuration so there is another button to reset the values to the initial values.

While in-game the player can access the *Pause Menu*, which offers the following options:
- **Music Volume Slider:**
- **FX Volume Slider:**
