{Brief Description}

## Music/Audio Style
-{Description of the Music/Audio Style}
Most of the FX that will be in the game are from "Kenney.nl" that are completely free and with no copyright. But, in some cases there will be modified with Audacity to suit to the type of game having a Sci-Fi thematic as lasers, robotic voices, etc.

In the case of music, there will be 16 bit tracks that will feel like in 80's. It will be inspired in some movies as "Kung Fury" or some games like "Far cry 3: Blood dragon".


## Music and Fx
- {Which musics and effects are going to be used and where} In-game, when there are no enemies between waves, the music will be calmed retro tracks. So, when the waves of enemies come, the music makes a smooth transition to a stronger track that will make the experience more stressful and will immerse the player to the game.

- {Menus} When the game starts and goes to the main menu,there will be a voice that says the name of the game and then in menu there will be a retro calm track.

- {HUD} We will have FX for the HUD from "Kenney.nl". Those FX will have a Sci-Fi thematic, like laser clicks.
