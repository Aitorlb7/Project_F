{Brief Description}
The game will follow a minimalistic approach to art, using low-poly, texture-less 3D assets. These assets are then rendered in isometric view to create a tileset compatible with our current pipeline.

## References
- {All art from where we drew our inspiration}

## Art Style
- We will be using the different aircrafts and vehicles available at [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets?q=3d), recolored accordingly to the game's palette. As long as assets are sourced from the same artist, 


- {Scenarios}


- {Level of Detail}
As stated before, we will use low polygon models as our source for assets. This assets don't use texture, only solid color. They are rendered with a hard light that creates three separate colours, for shadow, natural and highlighted sides. High level of detail is discouraged, since the game should be resolvable whilst zooming out, so assets should be clear based in shape and color only.

- {Camera}
The isometric tiles we will be using follows a width-height ratio of sqrt(2) (or 1.414:1)
- {Scale}
A tile should measure 151x107 px, and should still be resolvable viewed at 48px wide.

## Technical Guidelines
- {How to Export}
  All images will be exported as .png files. Tiles will not have a margin, both against edges and other tiles. 
  When possible, lowest file size will be prefered. For example, if exporting with any Adobe software, in the export settings should be set as 'best compresion'.
  
- {Tools}
  - Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator: This will be our go to tools for editing the final tileset we will be using. Both will produce same exact results when exporting as long as they are exported as specified 
  - [Asset Forge](https://kenney.nl/tools/assetforge): We have available this tool which will allow us to create more specific assets we might need. We do not expect to get most assets through this, but might come handy.
